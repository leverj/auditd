Best Practice Auditd Configuration

## Idea

The idea of this auditd configuration is to provide a basic configuration that

- works out-of-the-box on all major Linux distributions
- fits most use cases
- produces a reasonable amount of log data
- covers security relevant activity
- is easy to read (different sections, many comments)

## Sources

The configuration is based on the following sources

Gov.uk auditd rules
https://github.com/gds-operations/puppet-auditd/pull/1

CentOS 7 hardening
